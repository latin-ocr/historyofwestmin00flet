Tlec Datos of the Abbots 143

remained as abbot until this date. But he was deposed some years
before, as we shall 560 presently. We find his name in a charter of
K. Henry ΙΙ, attested by ‘Thomas the chancellor' at Dover, which
must, it 5661115, be dated early in January, 1156 (M emim. ch. xliv =D.
f. 62). Later than this we cannot traco him with certainty¹.

Laurence according to Flete ruled sixteen years, viz. from 1160 to
11 Apr. 1176.

But his name occurs 111 the foundation of Aucot priory as a cell
of Great Malvern, anno 1159 (llloomst. new ed. ΙΙΙ 455). The deposition
of an abbot and a new appointment would probably not take place
while the king was abroad: we should therefore look for a date between
April 1157 and August 1158.

Now there appears to be some ground for thinking that the appoint-
ment of Laurence did not immediately follow upon the deposition of
Gervase. For there is a charter of the ‘totus conventus' relating to
Deerhurst (D. 337 b), which refers to ζ(1611165105 quondam abbas} and
promises that the abbot from time to time will maintain what Gervase
had undertaken. It is attested by Helias the prior and Osbert of Clare,
and seems to have been granted before Laurence came in.

We may provisionally give 1157 as the date of the deposition of
Ger-vase, and 1158 as that of the accession of Laurence. This will
accord sufficiently well with the statement of John of Hexham, who
speaks of ‘magister Laurentius’ as one of the electors (22 Jan. 1153)
of Hugh de Pudsey to the see of Durham. He was exconnnunieated
with the rest, but having been absolved by the papal legate started
with the bishop-elect and others for Rome: ‘magister vero Laurentius,
divertens ab eis, apud Sanctum Albanum monachorum se contradidit
institutis, post paucos annos a rege Henrico monachis lVestmonasterii
sublimiter praelatus, amoto abbate Gervasio, filio regis Stephani, qui
res loci illius juveniliter dissipavi&

F lete's date for Laurence's death (11 Apr. 1176) cannot be maintained.

For the abbey of Westminster occurs among vacant ecclesiastical beneficos
111 the 19th year of K. Henry ΙΙ (1173)³.

¹ Gervase has a grant from Adrian IV (N icholas Breakspear‚ elected 3 Dee. 1154, died
1 Sept. 1159), confirming to the abbey its cell of Gt Malvern (D. f. 327). It bears date,
‘Lat viii Kal. Jun.'

2 John of Hexham’s Continuation of Sim. of Durh.y Rolls Ser. 11 329 f. Laurence was
not archdeacon: Widmore's statement to this effect depends on a faulty text of Geoffrey
of Coldingham, which has been corrected in Raine’s edition (Scriptores Tres, p. 5).

3 Mag. Rot. 19 H. 2, in Ced. ad Rot. 1 (Madox Hist. of Erech. c. x, νο1. 1 p. 309, ed.
1769). For the abbot's Gloucestershire lands ‘in manu regis’ 111 the sanie year, see ibid.

p. {gg The possibility of a yet longer vacancy might be suggested by a statement ibid.
