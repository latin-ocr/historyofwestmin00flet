2 Flete’s Historgs of Westminster

on fire, as we learn from the following laconic entry in the note-book
of Prior Essex (f. 64 b):

lifemoranduin quod anno regni regis Henrici sexti xxvi⁰‚ feria iva, xxv⁰ die mensis
Octobris, in festo sanctorum Crispini et Crispiniani‚ circa horam novenam in nocte
factum est incendium dormitorii per fratrem Georgium Norwyche.

Exhibited in the Chapter House (Fcszric. xxii 9) are the Letters
Patent of K. Henry VI, dated 8 Sept. 1448, releasing the abbot and
convent from the payment of §69—the moiety of a tenth voted in the
last Convocation3 because the king has learned ‘qualiter dormitorium
monasterii praedicti nuper per subitum ignis infortunium combustum
fuerit,' at a time when the Abbey was heavily burdened with a pressing
debt and unless aided could not complete the work of restoration before
Christmas.

The final account of the work was not rendered till Michaelmas
1450, and its total cost amounted to Γ16185, 01 considerably more than
§2000 of the money of to-day. It is interesting to see how the
Treasurer got together most of this sum. Forty pounds came in as
a legacy ‘pro anima Johannis Frensshe de Horsham.' The monks
subscribed 2516. 13. 4, and their tenants and servants 536. 14. 8. The
old timber of the dormitory was sold for about six pounds. Then there
was the 2569 of the dues relaxed by the king: but, what with fees and
gratuities to certain people of importance‚ not much more than fifty
pounds os this was realised. The following entry will shew how John
Flete had to transact the business:

Datum Domino Thesaurario ad concordandum cum ipso in pretio unius dolei
vini AEG.

From Michaehnas 1456 to Lady Day 1457 we find John Flete at

the N ovum opus again. But about this time he became Prior, and we
know nothing more of him till his death in 1465.

The Story of the Foundatz'on of the thcrch.

The first document which follows the Preface recounts in a summary
form the first foundation of the Church by K. Lucius in A.D. 184, its
degradation to be a temple of Apollo after the Diocletian persecution,
its reconstruction by K. Sebert and its consecration by St Peter ‘in the
spirit? This first extract, which is said to be taken from an ancient
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, I have not been able to trace to its source.
But, as we shall presently understand, it cannot be much earlier than
