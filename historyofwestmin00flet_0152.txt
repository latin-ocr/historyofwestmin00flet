140 Flete's H {story of W estminster

Note on the foreqozhy List.

The dates which Flete assigns for the accessions and deaths of the
abbots are so often demonstrably wrong for the eleventh and twelfth
centuries‚ that at the risk of making some fresh mistakes I feel bound
to attempt a provisional chronology. VVidmore made several corrections ;
but it seems certain that he never saw our great Chartulary, called
‘ Domesdaie Book '3 and therefore a good deal of useful material escaped
his laborious scrutiny. It may be premised that Flete knew the month
and day of an abbot’s death, for it was recorded in the Customary: it
was the year that was difficult to determine.

For the dates within brackets in the above list I take no responsibility.
They are given or implied in Flete's history. Of those which follow, the
earlier are sometimes uncertain 3 but they may be adopted at present as
approximately correct. The limits of uncertainty will be indicated in
the following notes, It is to be hoped that further evidence will be
forthcoming.

Ordbritht is named in the charter of offa, King of Mercia, 7853
and the second Alswy in the ‘telligraphus’ of 1002, ascribed to K.
Ethelred (‘ Domesd.' f. 80 b).

But our first secure date is the death of Wulnoth in 1049 (so Flete
and Florence of Worcester)¹. Edward had been elected king in June
1041, and had been crowned at Winchester on Easter Day, 3 April 1043.
Wulnoth was the last abbot of the old foundation, and the new church
was probably begun soon after his death.

We may assume that Edwin, a monk of the house, succeeded at once.
Flete assigns him ‘nineteen years and more’ of rule2. Yet he gives
19 Oct. 1049 as the date of Wulnoth's death, and makes Edwin die
12 June 1068. There are other reasons for challenging this latter date:
for two charters of the Conqueror making grants to Edwin (Aldenham,
D. f. 193 and Islip‚ D. f. 292)3 are addressed to Remigius bp of Lincoln‚
who can hardly have used this style before 1072, if so soon. Moreover
a third (Cleygate‚ D. f. 489 b) is addressed to Walkelin bp of Winchester,
who was not consecrated till 30 May 1070⁴. Unless we throw over the
whole of this evidence‚it is notlikely that Edwin died before 12 June 1071.

¹ 1049 (1050), in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.
2 There are variations of text to be noted: p. 82, ll. 3, 4, 23.

³ D. here signifies the Westminster ‘ Domesday.⁷
⁴ This charter deserves to be quoted, if only as a literary curiosity. Its original does
not appear to exist, and its genuineness will no doubt be questioned. Its concluding
