Conseerccftion by St Peter 7

he may—these are reduced to reasonable limits‚ and the whole story is
drawn together into a succinct form. The travelled monk‚ who has seen
Rome, and witnessed the consecration of churches (as he almost tells us
—‘ si prius interfuisset,' ἕω), shews incidentally his knowledge of ritual,
and gives us details which would hardly have been omitted by Sulcard
if he had found them already in the story.

Here then we have the tale as it was twice written down in the
days of William the Conqueror3 and we may well believe the statement
of Edward the Confessor's later biographers that it was told to that
pious king himself, and stimulated his zeal in the re-building of
St Peter’s church. Before we discuss it further, we may set side by
side with it what appears to be a quite independent account, given by
William of Malmesbury in his Gesta Pontificum Anylorzcm, the first
edition of which was published in 11251. There the foundation is
ascribed to Mellitus‚ who is said to have been urged to it by St Peter
himself. When the church was built, the apostle appeared and con-
secrated it, and sent a fish by the hands of a rustic as a present to the
bishop. In spite of the man's obvious ignorance—for he was no
Christian—the bishop believed his message3 for the description which
he gave of the apostle’s features corresponded with pictures which
Mellitus had seen. Moreover the consecration was attested by candles
that had been lighted, crosses made, and water sprinkled‚ as well as by
traces of holy oil. The bishop foi-bore from further consecration, and
uttered a prophecy of the future greatness of the monastery.

¹ According to Hamilton, Rolls Series edn, p. viii. The whole passage (p. 140 f.) is as
follows: ‘Tunc vero Mellitus deo cooperante, et Ethelbirhti tutus amminiculo, Chris-
tianitatis fidem egregie in provincia propagavit. nam et monasterium beato Petro in
occidentali civitatis parte fecit, ipsius apostoli, ut fertur, ammonitus nuntio: qui et coram
visus ecclesiam recens factam per se dedicaverit, et per rusticum episcopo xenium
gratissimum, grandem scilicet piscem, destinaverit. nec vero de dicto dubitare voluit, qui
videret agrestis fatuitatis hominem, qui nec Christianus esset, de Petro afferentem nuntium,
ejusdemque corporis lineamenta quae Mellitus nosset ex pictura veraciter pronuntiantem.
creditum ergo, nec consecrationis mysterium repetitum: quam perfectam monstrarent
candelae per totam ecclesiam accensae, cruces factae, nec minus aquae aspersae, et sacrati
olei locis debitis non frivola vestigia. cessit divino officio humana sedulitas, pronuntia-
vitque voce prophetica momenti magni futurum monasterium, in quo apostolus pontificale
exercuisset obsequium. sensim vaticinii veritas processit in medium, praesertim tempore
regis Edwardi ultimi, qui ampliori conventu ibidem adunato ecelesiam aedificationis genere
novo fecit. nec minus, sed multo etiam majus, rex WilleImus extulit locum, magnis
redditibus praediorum, quod ibi regni susceperit insignia: consuetudo igitur apud posteros
evaluit, ut propter Edwardi inibi sepulti memoriam regiam regnaturi accipiant coronam.’

episeopus, abbatem apud Westmonasterium fecerat, instructo ad xii monachos coenobiolo
in loco ubi quondam Mellitus ecclesiam sancto Petro fecerat)
