6 Flete⁷s History of W estminster

attested by the famous church of Westminster which St Peter conse-
crated on his behalf. The bishop had come in all readiness for the
dedication ; his tents fixed half a mile away, he waited for the Lord's
day to dawn. That night St Peter on the further bank of the Thames
called to a fisherman who was plying his craft, and promised him
a reward to take him over. Landing he bade him await his return.
The fisherman‚ amazed at the stranger’s more than earthly dignity,
suddenly beholds the church lit up with heavenly light, and a white-
robed choir circling round inside and out. He hears celestial music,
and had he been present at such a ceremony before might have followed
the consecration rite: as it was, he could scarce breathe for terror. The
apostle on his return, when all was over, calmed his fears and told him
the meaning of what he had seen. As they rowed across, he asked him
if he had caught anything that night, and then bade him cast his net.
He obeyed, and drew in a multitude of fishes, among which was an
enormous salmon (esicius). This he bade him take to Mellitus: the
rest were for his fare. Abundance of this kind he and his posterity
should have: only let them not dare to fish again on Sunday. ‘Tell
the bishop with this gift from me not to trouble himself about the

the morning he told the bishop, and confirmed his words with the
apostle's gift. Mellitus overflowing with gratitude hurried to the
church, which he found baptised in Jordan streams, the pavement
inscribed with symbolic letters, the walls anointed with twelve crosses,
besides the remains of twelve burnt candleS. What more should he do,
but celebrate, absolve and mess, and render thanks to God ἲ

There is so much phraseology in common that it is clear that these
two accounts are not independent: and it will hardly be disputed that
Goscelin's is the later, though it may be by only a few years. Sulcard
writes for the glory of the Abbey, and makes us feel this at every step.
Goscelin is composing a biography of Mellitus, and has no space for
irrelevant amplifications. The Thames and its tides, and its unusual
inundation3 the fountains that have ceased to flow: the rich citizen,
and the reward of his meek and quiet spirit3 the assembled multitudes
wrapt in deep slumber3 the new bride with her change of name—all
these drop out of sight. The profound horror of the fisherman, his
gradual restmation, his recognition that the stranger is good, be he who
