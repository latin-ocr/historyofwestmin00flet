viii Preface

introductory remarks deal with the growth of the legend of the eonse-
cration of the Chureh by St Peter ‘in the spirit ’3 with the authenticity
of some royal charters and papal bulls3 with the relies and indulgenees,
the effigies of the Norman abbots, and the ancient tapestries of the
ohoir. An attempt has also been made to correct F lete's inaeeuraoies
in the chronology of the abbots: but this is offered only provisionally,
and with a sense of misgiving.

The editor desires to recognise his obligations to the authorities of
Trinity College, Dublin, who entrusted to him their fragment of the
earliest manuscript of this history3 to Dr Edward Seott, the keeper of
the Muniments3 to Mr F. Lambert, the Assistant Curator of the
Guildhall Museum3 and to the Reverend R. Β. Raokham‚ who in
addition to much other good service has made himself responsible

for the index.
