Tombs of Early Abbots ‘23

Gervase (†1160): ‘under a small black marble stone at the foot of
abbot William de Humez.'

Laurence († 1176): ‘ under a marble stone with an image of him above
at the foot of abbot Gislebert!

Walter († 1191) z ‘in plano pavimento ante scamnum primum a
symbalo!

William Postard († 1201): ‘ante cymbalum?

[Ralph Papillon had been deposed, and was buried in the nave]

William de Humez (†1222): ‘at the head of abbot Gervase, in a marble
tomb with an image of him above in pontificals.'

Flete speaks of three only of these abbots as being commemorated
by effigies—Gislebert, Laurence and Humez. It is possible to trace
the remnants of a mitre on two of the figures even now: Dart figured
them as mitred two centuries ago (ΙΙ, opposite p. 12). Flete tells us
that Laurence was the first abbot to obtain from the pope ‘the
privilege of mitre and ring.'

The central figure of the three, then, which has a staff but no mitre,
is abbot Gislebert—the famous Gilbert Crispin, who was a favourite
pupil of Anselm at Bec.

At the foot of Gislebert‚ was Laurence: so that his effigy must
be identified with the easternmost of the three.

But at the head of Gislebert was Vitalis‚ and to him has been
mistakenly assigned the westernmost effigy: Flete’s description, however,
makes this impossible.

At the head of Vitalis was Gervase, ‘under a small black stone.‘
Curiously enough, in spite of this statement, the name of Gervase has
been cut in modern times on the largest stone in the eloiste1·,‘Long
Meg' as it has for some centuries been called—a stone which is also, for
some unfathomable reason, supposed to cover the twenty-six monks who
perished in the Black Death of 1349.

At the head of Gervase was William de Η111116Ζ, with his effigy in
pontificals. The effigy doubtless remains3 but it has been moved to its
present position at the head of Gislebert.

Dart shews the three effigies¹ as in front of the stone bench (plan
preceding Ι 71); shortly after his time, in 1752, they were set under
the bench as at present (Neale and Brayley, ΙΙ 294).

¹ He calls the third Vitalis: but in 11 p. xi he admits that he was misled by others,
and that it really represents W. de Humez.
