12 Flete’s H istory of Westminstcr

Evidences of the privileyes of Westminster.

The following charters are cited by Flete:

1. K. Edgar.
2. St Dunstan.

3. St Edward (three charters).

4. K. William the Conqueror (first charter).
5. Κ. Henry I.

9. K. Stephen.

1. Κ. Edyar. The charter which Flete cites begins thus:
‘Regnante domino nostro Ihesu Christo in perpetuum. Ego Eadgarus
Dei gratia Anglorum reX‚’ etc.1 It is printed in Dugdale, Monasticon,
ed. 1846, Ι 291; Birch, Cen-talariam Samonicum III 548. The authorities,
on which the text hitherto printed rests, are the Cotton MSS Faustina
A III (cent. xiv early) and Titus A VIII (which in part at least is copied
from the preceding). We may add to these the Westminster ‘Domesday'
(written c. 1308) f. 36 b. Nothing purporting to be the original of this
charter is known to exist. It is for convenience called ‘the great
charter' of K. Edgar.

There is still preserved a short charter of Edgar, which appears to
be genuine. If not the original, it is a very early copy: its date,
A.D. 951, causes difficulty, and should rather be 959. It is printed
by Birch,111 26οε less satisfactorily by Widmore and Dugdale. It is
classed among our muniments as Charter n0. V.

Of this there is an expansion‚ Charter no. VI, which inserts a clause
as to the consecration of the Church by St Peter, and another as to
freedom from interference and from impostS. It is followed by a recital
of further gifts to the Abbey. A copy of it is in ‘Domesday ' f. 79, and
it is printed by Birch, III 692 (together with 604).

An examination of the great charter of Edgar shews:

(1) that it is based on the expanded copy of the short charter 3

(2) that it embodies sentences and ideas from Dunstan’s charter 3

(3) that it agrees in wording sometimes with the first charter of the
confessor, and still more often with his third charter3

(4) that its signatures correspond at the outset with those of the

1 Contrast the beginning of the genuine charter of Edgar: ’ἧς Anno ab incarnatione

domini nostri Ihesu Christi DCCCCLI. Ego Eadgar divina alubesoente gratia Rex et
primioherius totius Albionis,' etc.
