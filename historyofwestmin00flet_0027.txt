It seems that Paschal's bull directed to Henry I has furnished much
of the phrascology of the Third Charter of the Confessor3 and that in
turn supplies part of the phrasoissogy of the great chartcr of Edgar.
It is noteworthy that Paschal says nothing of thc sepulture of kings, nor
of sanctuary.

4. K. W illium the Conqueror. A ‘Telligraphus' and three charters
of the Conqueror are transcribed in ‘Domcsday.' This ‘Telligraphus'
bears no date3 but in the body of the document we read that it was
granted at a council held in Westminster at Pentecost. Of this a
xiith (possibly xith) century copy exists (Ch. no. XXVI). The charters
are called the First, Second and Third respectively. The originals of
the First (1067) and Third (1077) are not known.

The First Charter only is quoted by Flete, who gives but a few
sentences of it. Most of it is in ‘Domesday ’3 but as ff. 53, 54 are cut
out, the end of the F irst Charter and the chief part of the Second arc
gone: they may be seen in Faustina A 111.

The Second Charter is still preserved (Ch. no. XXVII), and therefore
a few remarks may be made upon it here. It is mainly directed against
the incursions of the bishop of London and his ‘canonici,' and is couched
in strong language. In the body of the document the chartei· is said to
have been granted at a council held at Pentecost in Westminster, and it
is dated at the close as follows:

Anno dominicae incarnationis . ffi.lxx¹¹¹⁰ . quinto. etiam adepti imperii praenominati
gloriosi regis Willelmi anno . iiiit'0 . die predicti festi Pentecostes.x1m0 . kal Iunii .

· scripta est haec carta et sigillata, &c.

First‚ we may note that Pentecost 1070 fell on 25 May, whereas the
fourth day of the feast of Pentecost is here made to be 22 May.

Secondly, though it was William's custom to keep Pentecost in state
at Westminster, in this particular year he is said to have held a council
at Windsor at Pentecost.

Thirdly, it was at this council that he named Lanfranc as archbishop
of Canterbury, and Lanfranc only reached England on 15 August 1070,
and was consecrated on 29 August. But Lanfranc attests this chartei·
as archbishop of Canterbury ⁶ propria manu.'

A fragment of a seal in a silken bag is still attached to the charter
by a cord of twisted yellow silk, which is suspiciously like the yellow
