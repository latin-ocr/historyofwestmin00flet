INTRODUCTION

The History of Westminster Abbey, written by John Flete, in the
middle of the fifteenth century falls into four main divisions ι
(1) Τ116 story of the foundation of the Abbey,
(2) The evidences of its privileges,
(3) A list of relics and a list of indulgences,
(4) The lives of the Abbots.

A Preface is prefixed, in which the writer expresses his intention of
carrying his history down to the twenty-second year of K. Henry VI,
that is to A.D. 1443: but as a matter of fact the book breaks off with
the death of Nicholas Litlyngton in 1386.

John Flete first appears in the Chamberlain’s roll of 1420. Η6 was
one of the two Wardens of Queen Eleanor's manors² and the senior
of the two, from Michaelmas 1443 to Michaelmas 1446. During his
tenure of office there was drawn up a territorium of Holme and other
estates, which is preserved in a MS now at Cambridge (Univ. Libr.
Kk. 5. 29).

He was Custos novi operis, that is Warden of the new work on the
Church, in 1445-6, when we find that work was being done on the
little chamber over the great west door of the nave. In 1449-50
116 was Treasurer, and in this capacity he was responsible for the
restoration of the dormitory after the fire of 1447. George Norwich,
who was three years his junior, seems to have been born under an
unlucky star. In later years he mismanaged the affairs of the convent
so badly as abbot that he was forced to go into retirement, and he died
under a cloud in 1469. But his earliest exploit was to set the dormitory
