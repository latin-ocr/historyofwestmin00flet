Pastal Bulls 17

The problem of thc authenticity of these royal charters is a ‹lifficult
one. Their literary criticis111 can hardly be undertaken while they are
still unprinted3 and what 1138 here been said must be regarded as
tentative only.

The following papal bulls are cited by Flete:

1. John XV (986—999).

2. Nicholas II (1058-1061).

3. Pascha] II (1099—1118).

4. Innocent II (1130—1143): two bulls.
5. Innocent III (1198—1216).

The first two are no doubt composed by the writers of the charters
of K. Edgar and St Edward respectively, from which Flete quotes them.

Paschal’s bull was the earliest of a magnificent series of papal bulls,
stored in what was called the cista prima of the Abbey muniments, and
destroyed in the time of K. Henry VIII. An index of them, including
more than 200, was made at the end of the xivth century and still
exists (Munim. Lib. 12). Fortunately also a great many were transcribed
by the writer of ‘Domesday.' The first leaf of this book is lost, but
there is no doubt that Paschal's bull was the first item in the volume.
I have collated F letc's extract with the transcript in Faustina A ΙΙΙ
f. 157.

Paschal’s bull is dated ‘Laterani‚ iv Kal. Julii.' The following
passage in it is of interest: ‘Unde tam praesentium quam posterorum
noverit universitas dilectum filium nostrum Gilbertum, ecclesiae beati
Petri Westm. abbatem venerabilem, scriptis nobis significasse de quadam
controversia inter Robertum olim praesulem Lundon. et VVlnothum
abbatem Westmon. antiquitus orta3 videlicet, quod idem praesul
quasdam consuetudines, quosdam vero accessus, donationes etiam et
obsonia in 00010813 1113, contra etc„ studuit usurpare, etos Abbot Gilbert
died in December 1117.

The bull of Innocent II, directed to Henry I, was also on the lost
leaf of ‘ Domesday,’ and it has been copied by a later hand on a blank
space of what is now f. lb. Of his second bull, directed to abbot
Gervase, the last part still remains at the top of f. 1, and this gives the
single sentence which Flete has quoted.

The bull of Innocent III, dated :30 April 1199 and directed to the
abbot(Willia1n Postard), is found in ‘Domesday,’ f. 13. It is preceded
by two other bulls, dated 24 April of the same year.
