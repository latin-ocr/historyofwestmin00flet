PREFACE

THE only medieval writer who has attempted a history of West-

minster Abbey is John Flete, a monk of the house from 1420 to
1465. Sulcard indeed, nearly four centuries earlier, wrote its story,

part of Flete⁷s book in a manuscript which found its way with Cotton’s
library into the British Museum and thus became more easily accessiblo
to 1115 historiari and the antiquary.

where he can find no evidence.

To have accompanied this edition with adequate notes would have
meant an indefinite postponement of its publication, and would have
demanded an intimate acquaintance with monastic institutions to
which the present editor can make no claim. A trustworthy text
is the first and immediate need. This is what is here attempted. Some
