Consecrate'on bg] St Peter 11

In recasting Osbert's narrative Ailred has given himself a free hand
as to style: he introduces a reference to Jacob's ladder, and he fashions
St Peter’s conversation with the fisherman after 813 Luke’s account of
the Miraculous Draught. He adds practically nothing to the story,
except in making Sebert 13116 founder of St Paul’s as well as of
VVestminster—and this is corrected again in the extract given by Flete.
He omits all reference to Sunday, and also St Pcter’s promise to the
fisherman and his posterity: but he makes the apostle promise to visit
the new church and bless those who worship thero; and he refers to
the tithe of fish as a standing witness to the miracle, and very briefly
rel-ates that a fisherrnan had once refused to pay it and had suffered in
consequence.

The much later story found in the ‘Liber Regius' is chiefly drawn
from Ailred, but the writer knows what Ailred does not tell, that the
consecration was on Sundayg and he gives what no one has hitherto
mentioned, the name of the fisherman—Edric.

He still further elaborates the signs of the consecration, adding that
the altar was anointed, and three crosses carved on it: incense half-
consumed was also found upon it, and collected by the monks and
preserved as a relic. He makes St Peter command that tithe of salmon
shall be paid to the Abbey as a perpetual witness to the consecration:
and at the close of his narrative he speaks of the wicked parish priests
who have tried to prevent the fishermen of their parishes from paying
it. The failure of fish in the river is attributed to the neglect of the
apostle's injunction. Lastly, he tells that King Sebert lies buried with
his wife near the altar which St Peter dedicated.

The extract in Flete is abbreviated at the close. We find in Richard
of Cirencester (Spec. ii 17), who has embodied the same passage, a
fuller account of Sebert: the leaden coffins‚ mentioned by sule-ard,
are again referred tog and also the removal of Sebert's remains
seven hundred years after his death. Sebcrt’s epitaph is given, and
the date of his death (31 July 616), which had been preceded by that
of his wife Ethelgoda (13 Sept. 615).
