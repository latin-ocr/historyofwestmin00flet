Consecrat‘z‘on by Sc Peter 3

the middle of the twelfth century, because it already has the name of
Sebert as a founder. Certain of its phrases have a peculiarly West-
minster ring, and recur several times in Fletc's history. It is not
improbable that westminster had its own edition, with appropriate
supplements, of the old Saxon Chronicle in a Latin dress.

Of the consecration of the Church by St Peter Flete has transcribed
four narratives :

(l) From an ancient Chroniclc, beginning ‘Tempore quo rex
Ethelbertus.'

(2) From the Life of St Mellitus.
(3) From the Chronicle of Sulcard.
(4) From a Chronicle called ‘Liber Regius.’

1. The first extract appears, apparently as a separate piece, in
MS Bodl. 101 (see Hardy‚ Oataloyzce of Materials, Ι 192); compare
F lete’s expression (1, 28) ‘chronica quae sic incipit.' It is also quoted
by the Continuator of the Euloyizcm (R-olls Series, ΙΙΙ 342) as adduced
by Abbot Litlyngton before K. Richard II. It is found, however, in
the Life of St Edward by Ailred of Rievaulx (A.D. 1163), where it forms
the chapter entitled ‘ De ecclesia VVestmonasterii, quam sanctus Petrus
dedicavit' (Twysden, Decem Scriptores, col. 385).

2. The Life of Mellitus, from which the second account is taken, is
that by Goscelin which is found in Brit. Mus VespaS. B XX and
Harl. 105. Goscelin died about 1099: he was a monk of St Bertin, who
had come to England about forty years previously.

3. The third authority, Sulcard, was a monk of Westminster in the
time of Abbot Vitalis (1072-1081), to whom his work is dedicated.
In the British Museum there is a Westminster Chartulary, mostly in
a hand of the first part of the fourteenth century (Faustina A 111),of
which the first chapter consists of Sulcard’s tractl.

4. The ‘ Liber Regius ' cannot at present be identified. In a
footnote in the lower margin of the first folio of Flete a later hand
ascribes it to a monk of Bury St Edmunds, who is said to have written

it for K. Richard ΠΕ, Α book called ‘Liber Regius' was known to
William of Sudbury, who quotes from it in his tract on the Regalia

¹ It begins: ‘Hic incipit proloyus de construccionc Westmon. G. ἱ. Venerabili viro et
semper dei servo domino Abbati Vitali monachorum minimus frater Sulcardus cum devoto
famulatu et obsequio.’ The copy in Titus A vm is made from this, as may be seen by the
subsequent corrections which it has embodied.

² ‘ Cronica Regia ideo dicitur quia Rex Richardus secundus eam scribi fecit a monacho
quodam cenobii S. Edmundi de Berye.’
