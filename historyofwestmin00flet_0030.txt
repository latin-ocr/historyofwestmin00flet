18 Flete's Historgs os Westminstffl·

These royal and papal charters are followed in c. xii by a decree of
cardinal Stephon Langton, dated 1222, confirming the rights of the
Abbey as against Eustace bishop of London. There was granted to
the latter by way of consolation, and no doubt with a view of preventing
the reopening of the question, the maner of Sunbury on Thames, and
to his chapter the patronage of the church there——a right which they
still exercise to day. The original with all the seals is still preserved
(Memini. 127 53), and this has been printed in Rymer’s Foedera: it is
transcribed in ‘Domesday,’ f. 664 b. The document has a further
interest from its careful description of the bounds of St Margaret’s
parish.

After a summary of the results of his enquiry up to this point,
Flete proceeds in c. xiii to vindicate the customary tithe of salmon
caught in the Thames. He quotes a passage from abbot Ware’s
Consuetudinary (Pt IV c. viii), which is omitted from Sir E. Maunde
Thompson's edition on account of its fragmentary condition: what
rem-ains of it in the Cottonian MS is copied in the transcript which the
editor had previously made for the Dean and Chapter (p. 134).

Τ he Lists of Relics and of Indulgyences.

The List of Relics given in c. xiv is of great interest. Flete classifies
them under six heads: Relics of the Saviour‚ the Blessed Virgin,
Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, and Virgins. He names the following as
donors:

Kings: Sebert‚ Offa, Athelstan‚ Eclgar‚ Ethelred, Canute, St Edward,
William the Conqueror, Henry III, Edward I.
Queens: Emma (mother of St Edward), Matilda (bona regina), Alianora‚

Elizabeth (daughter of Earl Rivers3 1.6. Elizabeth Wydville, queen
of Edw. IV).

St Thomas of Canterbury.
Abbot Laurence.
Abbot Richard de Berking.

Simon, abbot of Bury: this seems to be Simon de Luton (1257-79).
Petrus de Graecia.

A prior of St Swithun‚ Winchester.
Thomas, earl of Lancaster.

Among the relics of St Edward, given by himself, the Regalia are
enumerated. It will therefore be of interest to print here, for comparison
