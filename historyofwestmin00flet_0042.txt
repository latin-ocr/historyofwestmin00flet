30 Flete’s History os Westmiofester

With regard to their ultimate fate Brayley writes as follows (Neale
and Brayley Westminster Abbey ΙΙ 273):

Dugdale, in his “ History of the Civil lVars‚'⁷ when speaking of the Parliament,
under the date ‘January 4, 1644‚’ has the following passage: “To glorify their
doings the more, they adorned their House of Commons with that whole suit of

Hangings which were placed in the Quire of the Collegiate Church at Westminster⁷
and some other taken out of the King's Wardrobe.'’

WVhether they were ever restored to the Church, does not appear; but it is most
probable that they never were, it being evident from Sandford's Prints of the

‘Coronation of James the Second and Queen Mary‚' that the subjects of the
Tapestry‚ which then ornamented the Choir, were altogether different from those
described above. On one piece, in particular, the Circumcision was represented3
a large remnant of which is still preserved in the Jerusalem Chamber, in the

Deanery.

The Mamcscript T radition of F lete's Work.

The most important manuscript (W) is that which is preserved in the
Library of the Dean and Chapter. Of this there are two copies: one
at Corpus Christi College> made for archbishop Parker; the other at
Lambeth‚ made by Wharton : the former of these is, as we shall see, of
some interest on account of its prefatory matter. The Westminster MS,
which necessarily forms the basis of this edition, is a small vellum quarto
of 58 leaves, written in the latter part of the fifteenth century. It contains
a good many blunders, and in at least two places has omitted a complete
line of its original.

That original is represented by a fragment (D) preserved in the
Library of Trinity College, Dublin. Ι am indebted to the authorities of
the College and to the kind mediation of the Dean of St Patrick's for the
opportunity of examining it side by side with the MS at Westminster.
It is numbered 548 (or E ΙΙ 32), and consists of two gatherings of
8 folia each, being the first and fourth of a book which was probably
made up of seven gatherings. It is on paper, and the leaves measure
10 in. >< 7 in. At the bottom of f. 1 is the name William Howard.
This, so far as it goes, is the earliest known authority for the text, and
it may come from John Flete himself. That the Westminster MS
is copied from this is evident, among other reasons, from its omission,
near the end of c. xvi, of the words ‘septem abbates successive presidentes
huic sancto loco ante‚’ which occupy a complete line in the Dublin

fra ment.
gLarge extracts from a MS of Flete, independent of the Westminster

MS, are contained in Claud. A viii, a Cottonian manuscript in the British
Museum. The first of these extracts‚ which begins immediately after
