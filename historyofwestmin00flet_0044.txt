32 Flete's [Ii-Story of Westmt'nscer

The Corpus Christi copy of Flete (no. 287) contains some
interesting pages at the beginning, which may perhaps throw light
on the history of the Westminster MS.

f. 3 is an inserted leaf of vellum, which bears the marks of having been folded
in four. It is closely written on both sides, and contains :

1. Α Letter of Dedication from ‘ Michael Refiiger’ to archbp Parker‚
dated ‘Lambethi 25Ο Octo.'

The following sentence occurs in this letter: ‘ Serius tamen quam pro opinione
mea venit hic liber in manus meas. Erat enim in arca quadam libraria longe a me
dissita inter alios domini Hugonis Latinier libros retrusus.²

2. A Preface as to the value of John Flete's work: dated as before.

ff. 4q5 b contain the sanie Letter and Preface written out in another and a neater

hand, and signed in each case with the initials only, ίΜ. R.’

Then follows :
xix⁰ ,Junii AO 1572.
Hic liber transcriptus ex veteri quodam libro scripto de fundatione Ecclesiae
westmonasteriensis; qui liber iam remanet in custodia D. Goodinan Decani ejusdem

Ecclesiae.

Michael Renniger (or Rhanger) was born in Hampshire in 1530,
and died in 1609. At the date in question he was prebendary of
VVinchester and chancellor of Lincoln. It looks as though he had
intended to bring out an edition of Flete.

An entry in the Treasurer's accounts for 1572 runs as follows:

To ΜΥ Carkett in Reward for Writing an old Gronycle of Westmr, xss.

We may suppose then that the MS now at Westminster once was in
the possession of bishop Hugh Latimer; that it was discovered amongst
his books and brought to dean Goodman3 and (though this is more
conjectural) that out of compliment to archbishop Parker the Abbey
paid for its transcription by Mr Carkett, an unknown scribe who
wrote a villainous hand.

Of the three lists of MSS in the Chapter Library before the fire,
only the third makes a mention of Flete. Was this the existing MS,
and if so how did it escape? Or was it perhaps the copy made by
Mr Carkett and paid for by the Dean and Chapter ἓ To these questions
there does not appear to be any answer now.

The task of the editor of Flete is seriously complicated by the
number of documents which he quotes verbatim. I have done what
I could to discover and collate these3 but occasionally I have allowed
Flete’s variation from his original to stand in the text. I have not
attempted to record all variants: but sometimes I have given them in
considerable fulness, in order to illustrate textual relations or the change
in the spelling of place-names.
