4 Flete’s History of Westminster

addressed to K. Richard II. This tract is preserved to us in the
Speculum Historiale of Richard of Cirencester (iii 3)1. Moreover it
would appear that Richard of Cirencester himself knew the ‘Liber
Regius ': for, though he cites no authority, he has embodied the whole
of our present extract except the first few lines in Speculum ii 17

(Mayor, 92 ff.)'·'.

What is the literary relation between these documents? Let us
take first the story of Sulcard, which must have been written between
1072 and 1081. King Ethelbert, having built a church for St Paul, is
anxious to secure for London the favour of St Peter as well. While. he
is considering the question of an appropriate site, a citizen of London
and his wife ask that they may be permitted to build the new church3.
The Thames with its tides surrounds Thorney island, two miles from
the city. Here this wealthy Christian4 erected a church, and asked
Mellitus to come and consecrate it. A day was fixed3 due preparations
were made, and the Christian folk were summoned from all quarters.
Tents were fixed half a mile from the ehurch, for an inundation of the
river prevented nearer access the night before. While all were wrapt
in sleep, St Peter appeared on the bank of the Thames, and called to
a fisherman to take him across. He might indeed have appeared on

1 Rolls 851155, ed. Mayor, 11 33: ‘Hoc etiam testatur alia chronica, qui Liber Regius
appellatur, in qua continetur: “Igitur post haec Hardecnutone filio Cnutonis de Dacia
veniente, a proceribus Anglorum in regem est susceptus. Qui statim inauditum commisit.
Haroldum enim...et in coemiterio Danorum Londoniae tumulatur.’' Et sequitur ad
propositum : “Hic quidem H. regalia sua in eodem reposuerat.'''

² Dr M. R. James has found among the MSS at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
one (no. 251) which has the Bury St Edmunds press mark and is entitled: ‘Historia de
Bruto rege Britonum cum aliis regibus Angliae linealiter ab eo descendentibus usque ad
regem Ricardum secundum, qui praesentem fecit compilari historiam anno regni sui
quarto decimo’: inc. ‘De patre istius Bruti historiae videntur dissonare.' But this does
not contain the passages in question. Dr James suggests that it may be an abbreviation
of the true ‘Liber Regius ’: it has marginal references to chapters of an unnamed work
which is the source of the greater part of the text.

3 This is contained in the passage which immediately precedes Flete's extract:
‘Cumque eidem insigni loco beatum Petrum pariter cuperet patrocinari, et ubi eius domus
exornari [poterat added later] volveret intentione speciali; ecce quidam civium urbis non
infimus cum uxore sua regi astitit, diutinam cordis sui voluntatem super construenda
eidem apostolorum principi ecclesia edicit, et super hoc ab ipso inclyto rege licentiam
devotus petiit: quo audito rex nimium est gavisus, annuitque et exhortatur praedivitem
ad desideratum opus, et ut hoc quam citius inciperet commonet attentius: qui regio favore
laetatus deo gratias agens domum repedavit laetissimus. illustrat praefatam urbem regius
amnis‚' δια, as in Flete. In the margin are the words ‘ Saberthus subregulus London.';
but Sulcard himself never names the wealthy citizen.

⁴ Flete has ‘praedives Christicola Sebertus’; but ‘Sebertus’ is not in Sulcard's text.
The same remark applies to ‘ille meus amicus Sebertus' lower down (9, 7).
