144 Flete's History of Westminster

His successor Walter, the prior of Winchester, was appointed in
July 1175, as we gather from Ralph de Diceto (110115 Ser. Ι 101 ; cf. 404).
His death is given by Flete as on 27 Sept. 1191 ; 11111 116 adds ‘ 2 1110. Ι,’
which would mean 1190; and this no doubt is the right year. For
Richard of Devizes¹ says that the abbey was vacant when K. Richard
left Sicily for the East in April 1191.

william Postard, the prior, was elected 9 Oct. 1191, 1116 monks
having successfully held out against William Longchamp’s nomination
01 1115 own brother, a monk of Caen'2. Flete's date for his death is
4 May 1201. But again he is a year too late, 11 1116 may trust Ralph
de Diceto.

For Ralph Arundel, prior of Hurley, was elected 011 30 Nov. 1200,
and blessed by the bp of London at St Paul's on 17 Dec.3 He was
deposed by order 01 1116 papal legate 23 Jan. 1214: so Flete, from
[7ἰονῶ Hist. 11 146 1.4

William Humez, prior 01 F rampton (co. Dors.), was elected 4 May
1214, as Flete tells us froin the same source (Flores ΙΙ 147 f.). His name
occurs in a charter (D. f. 497 b) dated on the fifteenth 01 that month.

For the later abbots Flete has better sources 01 information 3 but,
following an error of [Ποῦ-08 Historiarum, he inisdates the day of Richard
Crokesley's electiori : see above, p. 108 n. In regard to Philip Lewesham
his account varies so greatly from that 01 Matthew Paris (Rolls Ser.
V 701, 723), that I have followed Widniore in accepting the latter as
the moro trustworthy authority, and have placed the death of Philip
Leweshain and the election 01 Richard Ware in 1258. Indeed the
last date in the History of Matthew Paris is 25 May 1259, and he
died soon after: so that Philip Leweshani's death must have taken
place in Oct. 1258. Moreover the Register of Papal Letters (Ι 364)
contains two grants to Richard, abbot of Westminster, in March 1259.

CORRIGENDA.

p. 13, l. 3: for 989 read 969.

p. 17, l. 6: retal 1 John XII (955-963) or XIII (965—972).

p. 23, ll. 12—14. When Ι wrote this, I did not know that Sporley adds the words
‘absque mitra' in the description of Laurence’s effigy (see p. 94, l. 24). The effigy is so
time-worn that nothing certain can be said as to remnants of a mitre. But it is odd that

Dart should have figured one (vol. 11, opp. p. xii).
