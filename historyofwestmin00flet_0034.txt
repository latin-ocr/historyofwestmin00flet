22 Flete's History of Westminster

indulgence, though he would not deny its genuineness, caused Dr Lea
some misgiving. For in Rymer’s Foedera (Ι 150) it is placed under the
year 1208, as if it issued from Innocent ΙΙΙ, and the amount seemed
unusual for that period. But, as a matter of fact, the pope was
Innocent IV, and the date accordingly is 1254. For (1) the Index to
our papal bulls (Mzmim. Ek 12) notes it as under that pope 3 and (2) in
the same volume of the Foedera there is printed on pp. 517 f. a bull of
Innocent IV to K. Henry III, which bears exactly the same date:
‘ Dat. Assisii, 2 Kal. J unii, pontificatus nostri a⁰ XL'

The Lives of the Abbots.

The critical discussion of the last section of Flete’s work cannot be
attempted now. For it would involve an investigation of the history
of the Abbey during a period of more than 300 years. Indeed, it is as
a preliminary contribution to such an enquiry that F lete’s work is for
the first time printed here. Widmore has already quarrelled with the
dates assigned to some of the early abbots. We do not know what
source Flete drew upon, and his statements must be checked by facts
to be elicited from contemporary charters. One or two points of interest,
however, may conveniently be dealt with here.

In the south wall( of the cloister, under the stone seats against the
refectory wall, are three time-worn effigies of Norman abbots. Their
names have been variously assigned, but with Flete's aid we can identify
them with practical certainty as representing Laurence, Gislebert and
William de HumeZ.

Flete records the burial of eight abbots in the south cloister.

Vitalis (†1082)¹: ‘under a small white marble stone at the foot of
abbot ciffi-vase? A fair carpet and two candles were placed on his
grave each year on his anniversary : it seems therefore that he had
no effigy.

Gislebert († 1114): ‘ at the foot of abbot Vitalis in a marble tomb with
an image of him above.'

Herebert († 1140) : ‘in plano pavimento ante secundum scamnum
a symbalo versus hostium refectorii a parte orientali claustri?
This seems to mean, ‘in front of the second bench from the cymbal,
as you go from the east cloister towards the refectory door.'

¹ I give Flete’s date for the abbot’s death in each case.
