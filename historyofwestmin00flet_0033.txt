Lis-t of I'nd‘eclyences 21

quidam miles vocatus (lominus Simon Burlee, peracta coronatione, assumpsit regem
suis regalibus sic vestitum inter sua brachia, per portam regiam palatium ingrediens3
turbis hinc inde occurrentibus et illum len-ementibus in eundo unum de sotularibus
regalibus benedictis per incuriam ibidem amisit. Igitur nostrates caveant in
posterum ne ullatenus permittant regem cum insigniis regalibus amplius extra
ecclesiam exire3 sed ut moris est completa c‹‘›r‹‘›natione divertat in domum revesti-
arii, ut praedicitur, et ibi sua regalia ornamenta honeste deponat.

Compare also Adam of Usk’s Chronicle: ‘In coronacione istius domini
tria regalitatis insignia tria sibi infortunia portentabant: primo, in
processione unum de coronacionis sotularibus perdidit) &ez ed. E. M.
T hompson, 1904, p. 42; and for a further reference see his note on
p. ⁶202, ‘prophecia militis Francie ad ejus c‹1›ronacionem existentis, ubi
vidit regis sotularem ad terram cadentem ' (from MSS in Brit. Mus).

The Indulgences granted to the chureh of Westminster by popes
and other ecclesiastics are exceedingly dull reading to-day, as they are
presented in Flete's catalogue in c. xv. But the documents themselves,
as they may be read under the heading of the Sacrist's records in
‘Domesday‚' contain much that is of interest. The general subject has
been dealt with at some length in the third volume of Dr H. C. Lea's
Auricnbar Confessiov. The earliest indulgence which he unhesitatingly
accepts as genuine was granted in 1096 at the dedication of the church
of St Nicholas at Angers by pope Urban ΙΙ ; it gave relaxation of one
month of enjoined penance for the anniversary (Lea, ΙΙΙ 141). Then in
1132 Innocent ΙΙ, dedicating the monastery of Cluny‚ granted 40 days
for the anniversary (ib. 145). In 1145 Eugenius ΙΙΙ granted 7 days to
Pistoja, which had received a joint of the neck of St -James from
Compostella: and in 1163 Alexander III, dedicating St Germain des
Pres, granted a year on the actual occasion, and afterwards 20 days for
the anniversary. These early grants seem very meagre when compared
with the lavish indulgences of later times.

We have an indulgence which would take the second place in
Dr Lea's list, and it is marked by the sobriety of the period. It was
granted to abbot Herebert in 1121 by Peter de Cluny, the legate. of
pope Callixtus II, who received a scant welcome from K. Henry Ι, and
is said to have exercised no legatine authority at all. He relaxed
40 days of criminalia and a third of enjoined penance for minora to
those who visited the church ‘in martyrio Petri et Pauli apostolorum.'

Our earliest indulgence from a pope is that of Innocent IV (10243-54),
which grants a year and forty days for the festival of St Edward. This
