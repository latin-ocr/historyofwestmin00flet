24 Flete's Hefstory of Westminster

This then was the original order, beginning from the east:
Laurence.
Gilbert.
Vitalis.
Gervase.
W. de Humez.

The positions of the other three are not described with reference to
these, but with reference to the cymbal, which sounded for meals in the
refectoryg and we do not know exactly where that was placed.

W. Postard (before the cymbal).
Walter.
Hei-ebert.

It is possible that W. Postard was at the head of W. de Humez:
but he may have been on the other side of the walk next the cloister
garth.

Flete tells us that abbot Richard de Berkyng († 12461) among his
various benefactions to the church left two curtains or dossals of the
choir‚ which contained the story of the Saviour and of St Edward:
‘duas Cortinas sive Dorsalia chori, de historia dfii Salvatoris et beati
regis Edwardi, sumptibus propriis et expensis fieri procuravit, ac eidem
ecclesiae dedit et reliquit.'

Dr M. R. James has found in a manuscript at Gonville and Caius
College, Cambridge, in a volume of Robert Hare's Miscellaneous
Antiquarian Collections (MS 391 [611] pp. 130 ff), the following
account of the inscriptions on these tapestries, which he has kindly
copied for me.

(l) lee Anyell Gabrielc salutem our blessed Ladgs.
Virgo salutatur verboque dei gratulatur3
Nec gravat intactum gremium verbum caro factum.
Virgo parens humilis, quae chara deo, sibi vilis,
Anguem calcavit quem prima superbia stravit.

Hic plausus plorat, sitit unda, quiesque laborat,
Et via lassatur, et virtus debilitatur,

Luget laetitia, quasi stulta fit2 ipsa sophia,
Dum vagit Iliesus, flet risus et esurit esus.
