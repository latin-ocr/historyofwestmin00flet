20 Flete’s H istorgs of Westminster

The feast of Relics was kept at Westminster on 16 J uly‚ as appears
from the two Calendars printed in Dr Wickham Legg’s edition of
Litlyngton's Missal. The date of this list of Regalia is therefore
17 ὖ111γ 1359.

Of the three monks who drew up this list I have given an account
of one, John Redyng, in an article on Simon Langham in the Church
Quarterly Review (July 1908), where extracts from his chronicle
will be found. He died in 1368-9. John Bokenhull also appears in
connexion with Simon Langham at Avignon: we last hear of him as
being at Rome in 1:376. John Arundel seems to have been much junior
to these: he first appears in 1356-7‚ and he died in 1360-1‚ shortly after
this list was made. ,

In lines 10 and 17 we have the adjective ‘triphatam,' but in line 23
the substantive ‘ triphuris.' The writer who makes the addition
ll. 24—30 more correctly uses ‘triphuratam‚’ which occurs frequently
(‘triffuratus') in the VVestminster Inventory of 1388. A similar contrast
in language is seen in the ‘tecis aureis’ of the first writer (l. 22)
compared with ‘ platis aureis' of the second (l. 26). In l. 20 ‘floculos’
appears to be a diminutive of ‘floccus,’ and ‘glogellum' is perhaps
a diminutive of ⁴ gloga’ or ‘cloca ⁷ (cloclze), meaning a little bell—so that
we may call them ⁶ bell-shaped tufts.'

Other lists of the Regalia may be seen in the edition of Litlyngton's
Missal vol. ΙΙΙ, pp. 1521 f.: 0110 111 Latin of the year 1207, another in
French dated 28 Nov. 1356: but they do not enter into detail so much
as this. See also the Inventory ‘with an appraisement' made in 1649,
printed by our sacrist, the Reverend Jocelyn Perkins‚ in The Coronation
Book (Isbister, 1902) pp. 10 ff.

With the remarkable Memorandum as to King Richard’s shoe must
be compared the following passage from the Westminster chronicler
who continues Higden's Polychronicon from 1381—1394 (Rolls Series:
viil 2:22)¹:

[10 Mar. 1390] Item x⁰ die Martii misit rex Westmonasterium unum par
sotularium de rubeo velvetto gemmis margaritis ad modum florum deliciarum
confectum, a papa Urbano v10 parum ante ejus obitum benedictum, ad reponendum
ibidem cum aliis ornamentis regalibus ad regis coronationem spectantibus in
praefato monasterio custoditis. Constat namque quod rex statim post coronationem
suam domum revestiarii intraret, ubi sua regalia deponeret et alia indumenta sibi
per suos cubicularios adaptata assumeret, et abhinc via proximiori in palatium
suum rediret. Sed e contra fuit factum in coronatione istius regis, et male: nam
