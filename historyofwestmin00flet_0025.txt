Ramsey charter of Edgar (see Birch 111 639, 644). They are compatible
with a date between 981 and 984: but the dato assigned in the chartei·
is 989.

(5) that it cannot be much earlier than 1140, because Sobcrt is
introduced as founder.

A parchment placard (Ch. no. XB, 1 ft. 10 in. >< 1 ft. 9 in.) in large
letters of the xivth century contains two long quotations from Edgar’s
great charter‚ and also a passage from St Dunstan's chartcr. It was
evidently drawn up to be posted somewhore in the church. It begins:
Ver-eantur et paveant qui privileyz'a sea libertates hujus Ecclesiae in
aliquo violare vel insi-z'vzyere conantur. It belongs to the period when
the rights of sanctuary were much contested, probably to the reign of

K. Richard II.

2. St Dunsta'n. Flete cites about half of a long charter of St
Dunstan, which is still preserved (Ch. no. IX). It is written in a hand
of the end of the xith century, and has appended to it a scal, the
workmanship of which is attributed to the same period. The obverse
of the seal shews a seated episcopal figure with a pastoral staff and a
book inscribed PAX vomsoviu: the legend round it is »Β SIGILLVM
DVNSTANI ΕΪἾ LVNI—2 Its reverse, which is much smaller, has a female
figure standing, which may be compared with the somewhat similar
female figure on the reverse of the Worcester Priory seal, which indeed
may have suggested this to the westminster monks: in each case an
ancient gem would seem to have been appropriated. The legend here
is ᾖ DVNSTAN Ero plcoizfxi.

The date of the charter, A. D. 959, is required for Dunstan as bishop
of London: but it is incompatible with the other episcopal signatures,
which give 984—991 as limits. As a matter of fact the last two letters
of the date (DCCCCLIX) are over an erasure, and Richard of Cirencester
(ΙΙ 104) quoting this charter dates it 970 (LXX for LIX).

The document implies a struggle with London as to privileges in
general, and specially as to synodalia, burial of outsiders, and criminal
processes. In these matters it probably reflects the condition of affairs
in the Conqueror's reign.

3. St Edward the C'onfessor. Three charters of St Edward are
transcribed in ‘Domesday,' and may be conveniently read in Dugdale.
The First Charter, 28 Dec. 1065, describes the first embassy to
Rome, when Leo was pope, the relaxation of the king's VOW‚ and the
