Consecrate'on by St Peter 5

the island itself‚ but doubtless he desired as an eyewitness a man of his
own craft. It was with some difficulty that he persuaded the man to
take him over, for he wondered what a stranger was doing there at
that time of night. The apostle landed, and bade the fisherman await
his return. Then he struck the ground twice with his staff and
produced two springs, which long flowed till the tide washed away the
shore where they were. He proceeded to the church, attended now by
celestial choirs: the whole place was lit up with a splendour of light:
heaven opened to behold the apostle's work 011 earth. The fisherman
was held fast by terror, only to be released by the apostle, who on his
return restored his tottering senses‚ and then enquired what he had
seen and heard. Presently he revealed his name and the purpose of
his visit; and he bade him go the next morning and tell Mellitus‚ who
would find the signs of consecration on the anointed walls. The bishop’s
labour in that matter was not now needed3 but he should celebrate
mass and perform his episcopal ministry. Then the apostle promised
the fisherman a large haul in attestation of the vision: one fish he must
present to Mellitus in confirmation of his message‚ though the bishop
will probably have received some divine intimation already. Lastly he
bids him never fish again on Sunday: so he and his posterity shall have
good success. For this was the night of the Lord's day. Then the
apostle was withdrawn from his sight, and taken back into heaven. A
wonderful draught of the fish they call salmon rewarded the boatman 3
and the next day he delivered the message and the fish to Mellitus‚
who rejoiced for the honour paid him by the apostle. Entering the
church, he found the walls signed with sacred unction, and marks of
candles fixed upon them. Gathering in the people, he celebrated mass
and preached‚ and sent them penitent and joyful to their homes. The
church, God's new bride, obtained thenceforward 3 new name—no
longer the Isle of Thorns, but the West Monasteryl.

Such is the narrative of Sulcard—-or rather, a brief summary of it.
In striking contrast to his clumsy and long-winded tale stands the clear
and straightforward story of his contemporary Goscelin, the biographer
of Mellitus. The favour shewn by heaven to Mellitus‚ we are told, is

¹ After ‘nomen accepit’ (10, 9) Flete adds ‘etc.’; but Sulcard continues: ‘Consti-notor
autem ecclesiae multis cum uxore sua supervixit annis; et in ejus augendo provectu
laborabant studio sanctae intentionis: peractoque vitae mortalis cursu in eadem sepulti
sunt in plumbeis sarcophagis, sicut postea reperti sunt a quodam abbate ecclesiam re-
vocante aedificiis' [read with Richard of Cirencester (ii 17) ‘amplioribus renovante
aedificiis’]. Here again the name ‘Saberthus' appears in the margin.
