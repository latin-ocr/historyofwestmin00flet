The Βαίας Qf clm Abbots 141

Geoffrey, our first Norman abbot, probably came in at once. His
name appears as attesting the Cantcrbury Pri vilege at Windsor,Pentecost
1072 (Eadmer‚ Rolls Ser. p. 254). Flete says that he was deposed 111
his fourth year (or soon after).

The vacancy may not have been immediately filled. The letter
quoted by Widmore, Hist. p. 180, which the Conqueror wrote to John
abbot of Fecainp, asking him to send vitalis, abbot of Bernay, a cell of
champ, cven against his will to NVestminster, suggests that there was
some delay1. According to Flete, indeed, Vitalis must have been ap-
pointed in 1073. But the Winchester Annals give 1076 as the date of
his accession, and the Anglo-Saxon Chroniclc 1077 (1076).

In the Durham ‘Liber Vitae ' (Domit. A. vii, f. 52) there is a con-
vention between V italis and William of St Calais, who was consecrated
bp of Durham 3 Jan. 1081. Moreover he attests this bishop's Durhani
chartei· in 1082, and the Conqueror's confirmation of it in 1084 (Raine,
Scriptores Tres, pp. v, vi). Can we then accept Flete’s date for his
death, 19 June 1082 Ζ Not if these Durham charters are trustworthy.

Yet we find (D. f. 82) a grant by his successor Gilbert Crispin
to William Baynard, which is dated 1083. Our evidence is therefore
conflicting. If we abandon the Durham charters we can accept Flete’s
date, and bring in Gilbert in 1082 01 1083; but this, as we shall see,
appears for another reason too early. If, on the other hand, we suppose
that Gilbert’s charter, which is written into ‘Domesday' by a later hand,
is wrongly copied, we may make Gilbert's rule begin in 1085.

Now a Bec narrative, which relates a iniracle connected with the

words are to be compared with the ‘ post descriptionem totius Angliae ' of the well-known
Westminster charter which grants Piriford to abbot Gilbert (lemim. ch. xx1v).

2 No abbot of Westminster attests the decrees of the council held at St Paul’s in 1075,

though 21 other abbeys are represented (Wilk. Concil. 1 364).
