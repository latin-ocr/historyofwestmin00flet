Consecration by Sc Peter 9

has hitherto been known only from an abbreviation of it contained in a
MS at Corpus Christi College‚ Cambridge (110. 161). The full text has
however now been found in a Passiomde recently purchased for the
British Museum (Add. MS 36,737: f. 14412). I am therefore able to
print his narrative for the first time. It will be seen that it is in the
main an expansion of Gosceliffs, though it is touched up here and
there with a phrase from Sulcard.

It is specially noteworthy for two additions. In the first place, the
foundation of the church is ascribed to King Sebert. Now it is to be
observed that the only mention of Sebert up to this point occurs in the
prefatory sentences which Goscelin prefixes to his narrative (infr. p. 38);
and these sentences are taken word for word out of Bede Hist. Eccl. ii 3.
There Sebert is mentioned as Ethelbert’s nephew, who ruled as his
subordinate in London: but there is no suggestion that he was con-
cerned at all in the building of the new church of St Peter. In fact,
these sentences, though forming an integral part of the Life of Mellitus,
have no special connexion with the story which happens to follow them.
It is however a reasonable conjecture that this juxtaposition suggested
the name of Sebert as the founder. At any rate it is when Osbert
recasts these opening sentences that Sebert first appears in that capacity.

The second serious addition occurs at the close of his narrative.
The descendants of St Peter's fisherman still to this day, he says,
honour the apostle with the tithe of what they catch. And he adds a
long tale of the misfortune that befel one of them who in recent times
had endeavoured to cheat the monks of their due.

Osbert's narrative is as follows:

De ecelesia sancti Petri Westmonasterz‘c' quam idem apostolus per se dedicavit.

Antiquum beati principis apostolorum et insigne monasterium non recens, non
novum, non moderno tempore constructum, sed a diebus servi dei Augustini, primi
Anglorum apostoli, a Saberto Orientalium Saxonum rege copiosa dicitur caritate
fundatum. hic nepos sancti Ethelberti regis exstitit, quem Christi praedicatione
sanctus Augustinus imbutum in urbe Cantuaria baptizavit. administrante vero
pontificatum Lundonensis ecclesiae MellitO, sub titulo beati Petri apostoli dedicanda
erat ecclesia ad occidentalem urbis plagam extra muros sita. sed, ut gestae rei
persequamur ordinem, paratis praesul rebus venit ad dedicationem: tentoriis autem '
a dimidio fixis miliario crastinum illucescentis dominicae diluculum expectat, ut
aurora fulgente expeditus occurrat. verumtamen dominica nocte ille caelestis aulae
janitor in ulteriore ripa fluvii Thamensis astitit, qui eidem monasterio ab orientali
parte vicinus subtercurrit. vocat itaque piscatorem, qui praedam exercebat flu-
vialem : ad alteram ripam se poscit exponi, mercedemque dum redeat praestolari.
transposito amne persona recessit ignota ; donaria piscator expectat promissa:
stupidus interim repente contemplatur ecclesiam supernis in circuitu luminaribus
plenam flammarum globos caelitus emittere, et candidatorum choros nunc initus
