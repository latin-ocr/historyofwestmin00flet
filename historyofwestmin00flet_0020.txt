8 Flete's History of Westminster

The first point to be observed in connexion with these three
narratives is that down to the year 1125, at any rate, there is no
mention 01 King Sebert as the founder. Sulcard is plainly ignorant of
the founder's name. Before his days, under some abbot whom he cannot
name, two leaden coffins were found in the church on the occasion of its
enlargement. We may suppose that Eadwine was the abbot, and that
the Confessor's rebuilding was the occasion of the discovery. It was
natural to conclude that these were the coffins of the founder and his
wife, whoever they may have been. A nameless citizen of London thus
comes to figure in Sulcard's story.

Το Goscelin 1116 matter is of no interest; though, 11 Μ61111118 had
himself been the founder, he would 01 0011186 have mentioned this 10
1118 credit. Goscelin's silence, indeed, justifies us in setting aside the
statement of William of Malmesbury, though twice repeated, that the
church was built by Mellitus

The next point of interest is that there is thus far no indication 01
any strained relation with the 866 01 London. It has been often said
that the story was invented by the monks of Westminster 10 support
their claim of exemption from the bishop's jurisdiction. No doubt it
was used, and with great effect, for this purpose in later times, and we
shall presently see that the story has this turn given to it. But it was
not a weapon forged for this particular combat. Indeed, Mellitus is
treated with the highest respect by Suloard3 and Goscelin delights in
the tale as one of the most honourable events in the bishop’s career3
nor does William of Malmesbury find it inconsistent with the foundation
of the church by Mellitus himself.

Thirdly we note that another purpose to which the story lent itself
in after days is not among the motives 01 118 origination. There is no
suggestion in these early narratives 01 1116 customary payment of the
tithe 01 salmon to the Abbey.

Ailred's narrative, to which Flete gives the place of honour, is in
fact only a reproduction, in a somewhat less inelegant style, of the
corresponding chapter of Osbert's Life of St Edwardl. Osbert's work

¹ Osbert of Clare, a monk of Westminster, seems 10 have been banished from the
monastery under Abbot Herebert, c. 1128 to 1130 ; but about 1136 he was back again and
was made prior. About 1141 he went to Rome, and on this occasion wrote a life of
Edward the Confessor which he dedicated to the legate Alberic‚ imploring assistance for
the obtaining of 1118 canonisation. This however was not granted until 1161. Osbert’s
letters, from which the chief facts as to his life are drawn, were published by R. Anstruther
in Scriptores Monacm, 1846.
