14 Flete's He‘storgs of Wescminster

vision of the hermit Wulsin. It deals mainly with properties3 but it
also recites the gift of certain relics, and it grants free electiori of the
abbot. The original is in the Hatton Collection (see Archaeol. Journal
xix 176).

A notarial copy of it, with the omission of some paragraphs as to
properties, written in 1313, 18 preserved at Westminster (Oh. no. XXI).

The Second 01101101, 1 Aug. 1045, specially guards against episcopal
intrusion. It mentions Robert bishop of London and Wulnoth abbot of
Westminster as having been at strifel. The original 18 111 the British
Museum (Cott. Aug. ΙΙ 58, somewhat mutilated and without its seal).

The Third Charter, 28 Dec. 1065, continues the story of the First
Charter, and tells of the second embassy to Rome, in the time of pope
Nicholas. Incidentally it mentions St Peter’s consecration of the
former chureh, but it says nothing of Sebert. It deals with the
confirmation of privileges, and specially with the right of sanctuary.
The original of this, with a broken seal, is preserved (Ch. no. XX): the
concluding lines, which contain the date, are written in a browner ink,
though apparently by the same hand.

The genuineness of these charters cannot be maintained3 but St
Edward's 8001 18 somewhat of 0 mystery. There are other examples of
it, attached to short Saxon charters, which deal with special properties
and are probably genuine. But the 80018 attached to the First and
Third Charters cannot be accounted for as transferred from other
chartei-s. It is possible that the monks possessed the matriX‚ and used
it on such solemn occasions as the remodelling of their short Saxon
documents, which were unintelligible to the Normans, into the impressive
Latin charters which presented their interpretation of the privileges
given them by their founder. On such a hypothesis alone can we
mitigate the charge of deliberate forgery.

Into the literary criticism of these documents we cannot fully enter
here: but it may be of interest to cite a few sentences from the bull of
Paschal H (1099—1118), quoted by Flete, italicising words which appear
in the Third Charter of the Confessor.

to St Edward quoted in the charter).
