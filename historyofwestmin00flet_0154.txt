142 Flece's H &story of W estminster

Crispin family, states that Gilbert Crispin was abbot of Westminster
for thirty-two years. Flete accordingly dates his death 6 Dec. 1114.
This is certainly wrong: for Gilbert made a convention with William de
Bokeland (D. f. 528), which was attested by Bernard bp of St David's‚
who was not consecrated till 19 Sept. 1115 ; and his death is placed in
1117 by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Winchester Annals. If we
accept this date and combine with it the statement of the Bec narrator,
we cannot bring in Gilbert before 1085. This is Widmore's conclusion,
and until further evidence appears we had better accept it. But we
must bear in mind that Widmore did not know of Gilbert’s grant which
bears the date 1083.

After Gilbert’s death there was a vacancy for miore than three years.
It is perhaps to be accounted for in part by the king's absence in
Normandy. He returned in November 1120, the fatal month of the
loss of the White Ship. Two new bishops were appointed early in
-January 11213 and at the same time, according to Eadmer (Hist. Nov.
p. 291, Rolls Seu), Herbert was made abbot of Westminster. The date
is attested by a grant confirming privileges which he obtained in the
course of 1121 from Peter of Cluny, the papal legate (D. f. 411).

Flete, however, makes Herbert rule from 1114 to 3 Sep. 1140, assign-
ing to him six and twenty years. He is wrong at the end as well as at
the beginning3 and if 116 has dated his accession too soon, he has dated
his death too late. It is truc that a note in the Chetham MS of Flores
Historiarmn gives the same date for his death: but it is added in a
xvth century hand, and may not improbably depend on Flete.

Although we cannot fix the date of his successor with certainty, we
know that it must be earlier than 1140. For Gervase received a con-
firmation of privileges from Innocent II (D. f. 1), which bears the
attestations of pope and cardinals and the exact date, 22 April 1139, at
the Lateran. And a grant of the same pope, dated also at the Lateran
on the same day (x kal. Mai), confirms a grant made by Gervase of
property at Hendon (D. f. 129). So it seems likely that Gervase was
already abbot in 1138, if not sooner¹. He was the natural son of king
Stephen‚ who came to the throne 26 Dec. 11352.

Flete makes Gervase die on 25 Aug. 1160, and supposes him to have

1 It is possible that there was a gap between Herbert and Gervase: for there is a
charter of the Convent as to lands in Eastcheap, which from the names of the witnesses,

and from the clause ⁴ ardeat civitas necne,' I incline to date about 1136 (D. f. 528 b). There
was a very great fire in London in 1135.

² William of Malmesbury says that no abbot was present at Stephen’s coronation
(which he places on 22 Dec).
